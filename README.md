Scope Toggle hotkey addon for [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly) (v1.5.1)

# Installation
* Cram it into the gamedata like a baws.
* If you get a conflict with `ui_keybinding.xml` you will have to merge the changes yourself.

# But Why?
This mod adds a new keybinding (`Toggle Scope`) to the settings menu under weapons section. Pressing this key while holding a weapon will quickly attach the *first* compatible scope from your inventory.

If the weapon already has a scope attached, it will be removed and remembered as the "preferred" scope for that weapon. If your favorite scope is not picked, just attach it first manually and the mod will honor your preference from then on.

The mod will also remember the last firing mode before attaching/detaching the scope, so you will not have to fumble with the fire mode switcher during a firefight.

# Known Issues
* After switching scopes, **AN-94** may fire with wrong RPM in two-shot burst mode.
* After switching scopes in single-fire mode, the mode switcher may seem "stuck" for the next keypress. You may have to press the switch button twice to change to next fire mode.
* Not tested with grenade launcher attachments. Might eat your grenades. 
* If you switch scopes for the weapon in the first slot, the weapon will be unequipped into inventory. Only use it for second (main) slot.
